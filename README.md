# Jabberwocky Open-Source Stacked Acrylic Case

The Jabberwocky is a full-size columnar-staggered Alice-like split, inspired by the Boardrun Bizarre (designed by shensmobile). It utilizes 2x2.25u Shift keys (like a 660) and moves all of the upper nav cluster keys into the function row (similar to an 1800).

PCBs and DIY kits are available for purchase [here]() and through the [NoPunin10Key discord](https://discord.gg/GVanAmPDCH).

In this repository you'll find files you can use to make your own stacked acrylic case. There are versions for the Dexterous (Right-Handed Numpad) and Sinister (Left-Handed Numpad) variants of the Jabberwocky keyboard.
In total, your case will be composed of **6 layers**.

If you are in the US and do not have access to a laser cutter, I personally recommend [P3DStore](https://p3dstore.com/products/custom-printing-laser-cutting-services) for custom cutting services. You should be able to upload these files and this readme to specify layers and hardware required. You can also source the hardware separately.
P3DStore's in-stock acrylic colors gallery is available to view [here](https://p3dstore.com/pages/in-stock-acrylic-color-options).
